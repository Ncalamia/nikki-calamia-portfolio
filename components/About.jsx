                <p className='text-[#2b3637]'>Iâ€™m a software engineer with a passion for building programs that improve daily life. With 5 years of experience in the clinical side of healthcare, I have seen first hand how technology can affect efficiency. My dedication for helping others, along with the need to solve problems, motivates me to work hard everyday. With my experience, I have acquired many transferable skills such as: functioning effectively under pressure, working cohesively in a team setting or working productively alone and learning to adapt quickly to a fast paced work environment. I am enthusiastic about learning new things and am looking for the opportunity to create something that genuinely makes an impact. </p>
